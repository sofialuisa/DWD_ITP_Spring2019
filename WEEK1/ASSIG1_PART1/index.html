<h1>Post-photographic topographies</h1>
<h3>by Sofía Luisa Suazo Monsalve</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">
<i>Post-photographic Topographies</i> is a research based artistic exploration centered on the perceptive effects of automated vision systems in the contemporary context. The project focuses specifically in the post-photographic and post-humanist concept of “Nonhuman Photography” proposed by the writer and artist, Joanna Zylinska. As the author explains, the concept can be understood as “the execution of technical and cultural algorithms that shape our image-making devices as well as viewing practices”. It is the practice of photo making powered by the symbiosis between human vision and security cameras, drones, medical body scans, mobile photography, satellite images, and other platforms and technologies that enable the unfolding of a photographic practice that is continuously decoupling from human vision but at the same time inevitably shaping it –and by extension, constructing and deconstructing the setting from where it emerges and sustains itself, namely, our world.

Through the implementation of three artistic experimentations, Post-photographic topographies explores and questions the world-making power of nonhuman photography, by addressing the following inquiries:
<ul>
  <li>How is the environment being seen and experienced by automated vision systems and how is this specific way of world seeing affecting the way humans interact, navigate and position themselves on Earth?
</li>
  <li>Can nonhuman photography, as an artistic practice, delineate, document and explore the posthuman condition?
</li>
  <li>Can nonhuman photography expose the aesthetic and epistemological reach of automated vision in the contemporary world?
</li>
</ul>
The project is concibied as a series of three coordenates:

<p style="text-align:right">“ … photography is a form of stabilized perception
and impression that occurs across various mediums,
 like rocks, paper, skins.”
- J.Zylinska</p>


<p style="text-align:justify"> If photography is seens as a fossil, as the act of materially encapsulating time, then the photo making practice  becomes a time measuring practice.

But in the age of the dematerialization of photography, how can this photographic measure of time take a material form?  Specially considering that for the most part, contemporary photography takes the ungraspable form of an infinite flow of pixels.

This project tries to bond to seemingly opposed conditions of contemporary photography:  the dematerialization of the photo taking process, and the never before seen massive amount of photographs posted on social media each day.

Every second roughly 1000 images are posted on instagram. If these thousand images, or in other words, this one second of time passing would get fossilized, a photographic measure of time would take form.

 <p style="text-align:justify">
The first photograph ever taken is a window view and it already exposes a very nonhuman aspect to it, since it shows lights and shadows from both sides of the picture because it needed 8 hours of exposure. The human eye could not have seen this lighting setting, if it weren’t because of the photographic apparatus.

This nonhuman vision, this glitch of light, inaugurates the history of photography and serves us as a premonition of the automated vision systems that were to come.  Google Street View (GSV) is one of these systems, that stands as the ultimate realization of vision.  GSV is the all seeing, always present eye, that liquifieds photographic referentiality into cyberspace,  into an omnipresent stream of bytes.
For this project I use GSV to visit historically relevant places for the history of photography and made screen recording of these cyber travels, and by exploring the footage carefully, I found these glitches which usually happen while moving from point a to b, or while zooming in and out, in the space between 2D and 3D representation of space.

I screenshot this glitches and made an architectonic model of them with the intention to portray this mutable state of contemporary photography that gets unfixed from statism to constantly recreates or reenacts reality, thus having an active and creative role in contemporary world making. Also, to point out that as real as this can look, they are still translation. So this mock up is portraying the world that emerges from that in between space of translation, a sort of 2.5D glitch world, if you will.</p>

  <p style="text-align:right"> “When a photographer is at work nowadays,
she does so as a hybrid artist, thinking, manipulating
and encoding information with neurons
in both the brain and the retina,
working with muscles, motors, transistors,
and millions of lines of code.
Photographers are cyborgs.
- Blaise Aguera y Arcas</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
  Taking as a starting point that there is no such thing as a natural image, then image making can be set free and emerge within the margins  of artificial worlds too.

  In the simulation games The Sims 4, the characters within the simulation (sims) are able to take photographs with a range of different cameras, which they can also upload to their own version of instagram, Simstagram.

  In this project I practice photography as  a disembodied practice by making pictures  inside the simulation game The Sims 4. I will  then use a machine learning model (pix2pix) to synthesize “real” looking landscape photography based on the photographs that my avatar inside game takes.

  The idea is to portrayed the simbiosis between the digital/artificial and the analog/real world, and how the imagery of both informed each other and by doing so, influence and shape one another.</p>
